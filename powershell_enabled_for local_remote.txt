1. Configure WinRM on the Remote Machine
Ensure that the WinRM service is running on the remote machine:

Open PowerShell as Administrator on the remote machine.
Run the following command to enable WinRM:

powershell
Copy code
Enable-PSRemoting -Force
To allow connections from non-domain computers (like workgroups), configure TrustedHosts:

powershell
Copy code
Set-Item WSMan:\localhost\Client\TrustedHosts -Value "WIN-V1S1KJM6MLU" -Concatenate
If you need to allow connections from multiple computers, separate them with commas.

Make sure the WinRM service is set to start automatically and is currently running:

powershell
Copy code
Set-Service -Name WinRM -StartupType Automatic
Start-Service -Name WinRM

PS C:\Users\Administrator>
>>                 $securePassword = ConvertTo-SecureString 'Sasasa1' -AsPlainText -Force;
>>                 $cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('Administrator', $securePassword);
>>                 Invoke-Command -ComputerName WIN-V1S1KJM6MLU -Credential $cred -ScriptBlock {
>>                     Enable-PSRemoting -Force;
>>                     Set-Item WSMan:\localhost\Client\TrustedHosts -Value 'JIMPENGTHAI92' -Concatenate;
>>                     Set-Service -Name WinRM -StartupType Automatic;
>>                     Start-Service -Name WinRM;
>>                 }

WinRM Security Configuration.
This command modifies the TrustedHosts list for the WinRM client. The computers in the TrustedHosts list might not be
authenticated. The client might send credential information to these computers. Are you sure that you want to modify
this list?

2. Configure WinRM on the Local Machine
On the local machine, configure WinRM to connect to the remote server:

Open PowerShell as Administrator on the local machine.
Run the following command to configure TrustedHosts:
powershell
Copy code
Set-Item WSMan:\localhost\Client\TrustedHosts -Value "WIN-V1S1KJM6MLU" -Concatenate
Restart the WinRM service to apply the changes:
powershell
Copy code
Restart-Service WinRM

PS C:\WINDOWS\system32>
>>                 Set-Item WSMan:\localhost\Client\TrustedHosts -Value 'WIN-V1S1KJM6MLU' -Concatenate;
>>                 Restart-Service WinRM Y
